#Incomplete and growing list of papers reporting NMR, EPR and Mössbauer experiments and calculations
The following list of papers has been collected over the years. Here you can find NMR/EPR/Mössbauer
results, both experimental and calculated. This list focusses mostly on inorganic, solid state, compounds.
The main purpose is to provide a database of NMR/EPR/Mössbauer parameters to establish, for instance,
NMR reference values.
